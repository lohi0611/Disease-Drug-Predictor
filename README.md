# Disease Drug Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies **data mining** and **machine learning** techniques to analyze patient symptoms, predict possible diseases, and recommend suitable drugs. It aims to provide healthcare assistance in cases where immediate access to medical professionals is limited.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Predicts diseases based on symptoms using ML algorithms
* Recommends appropriate drugs for the diagnosed disease
* Easy-to-use interface for patients to input symptoms
* Helpful in critical situations where doctors are not available
